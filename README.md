# WHAT?
- Mugen, fighting emulator does not have mapping for the back button, or ESC key.
- this is anoying, since with no back button, the game is unplayable with controllers only
- this app maps the back button on any connected controller to the escape button

# WHY?
- because: "Just use a third party mapping app" sounds stupid and an overkill, to get basic functionalities
- this code has 32 lines and it does the job.
- all you need is python and pip. the code is transparent, easy to use, and above all, simple
